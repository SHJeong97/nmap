# 🛡️ Nmap for Cybersecurity | Network Scanning & Enumeration

## 📌 Overview
This repository documents my **hands-on cybersecurity practice with Nmap**, focusing on **network discovery, service enumeration, and security reconnaissance**.  
The goal is to demonstrate practical understanding of how Nmap is used in **defensive security, SOC analysis, and controlled security testing environments**.

The work here emphasizes **methodology and interpretation of results**, not just running commands.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand Nmap scan types and when to use them
- Perform host discovery and port scanning safely
- Enumerate services, versions, and operating systems
- Analyze scan results from a defensive security perspective
- Practice ethical reconnaissance in controlled lab environments

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Nmap**
- **Linux (Ubuntu / Debian-based systems)**
- **Bash & Shell utilities**
- **Git & GitHub**
- **Terminal-based workflows**

---

## 🔍 Key Skills Demonstrated
- Network reconnaissance fundamentals

### 🧪 Learning Sources & Attribution
Some exercises and foundational practice in this repository are inspired by hands-on cybersecurity labs completed on LabEx.io.

Labs are used strictly for educational purposes

Commands and notes are written in my own words

No proprietary lab content or restricted solutions are shared

This repository reflects my personal learning process and applied understanding, not copied platform materials.

### ⚠️ Ethical Use Notice
All Nmap activities shown in this repository were conducted in:

Authorized lab environments

Personal test systems

Controlled learning platforms

### ⚠️ Unauthorized scanning of networks you do not own or have permission to test is illegal and unethical.

### 📈 Learning Approach
Incremental scans from basic to advanced

Emphasis on understanding why a scan is used

Defensive interpretation of reconnaissance results

Focus on blue-team and SOC relevance
